# Command Line Interface (CLI) Login Java

### Description
- CLI Login Java is a smaller program that simulates a sign in/up process through the command line.
- Nothing too special or complicated about this repo, other than just playing around with the java programming language and wanting to test out different packages and, maybe, build my own useful package in the process.

### Basic Security
- There is a simple security [`Security.Secure`] package for simple password encryption and decryption using a basic Caesar Cipher technique

### Basic Testing
- This program also utilizes simple unit testing techniques using JUnit4

### Forking and Cloning
- Feel free to fork and clone this simple program; refactor and add as you please. Still currently working on program with my own revisions.
